    This is my website.
    <br>
    And this is my story.
  </p>

  <h1>My Story</h1>
  
    <p>
    	My story is way better than the story of Learn Enough to Be Dangerous. Why is 'Be' written in capital anyway? That just testifies the <em>superiority</em> of my own, great mind. And no, I'm totally not doing that tutorial right now. So where do I start? Where do I end? Let's try a media res here: And the ball came flying directly at my head. With all my might I made a ridiculous jump to the side of the field! BAM! The ball hit my right eye. My parents rushed me to the hospital, but all for naught. After the removal of the eye, everybody called me Pirate Meister. The nurse tried to sell my the idea of her liking pirates. When I hit on her, she rejected me. <strong>That's when it all began...</strong>
    </p>

  <h2>How I got here</h2>
  
    <p>
    	Well, that's kinda funny. You know, when you are <strong>that</strong> young, you think it's all fun and games. And then <em>IT</em> happens. <strong>B</strong>ig <strong>F</strong>ucking <strong>D</strong>eal, or BFD for short. It tool a lot of willpower to evade all this bullshit in this world. Well, I could just not do it any other way. it was <a href="http://www.youtube.com">Kill or be killed</a>. And to be honest, who wants to be killed? So I just took my dads money and went up and away and got super rich. 
    </p>

  <h2>Did I want to get here?</h2>
  
  <h3>Why is my dog so important in the current state of affairs?</h3>

  <p>
  	Finally we get to my dog, eh. Would've been time about now anywasy. That little shrillershuck just walked around and about everywhere I went. I was never a big fan of dogs. That ole stinky animal, losing hair and if wet stinking like a <a href="http://facebook.com"><em>three</em> week old corpse</a> on a hot summer day. 

  	And then, there were just these three test-texts:
  	<em>1. I don't care.</em>
  	<strong>2. I really don't.</strong>
  	<strong><em>Why wouldn't you believe me, sucker?!</em></strong>
